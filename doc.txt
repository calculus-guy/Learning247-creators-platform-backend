### Requirement 12: Two-Factor Authentication for Withdrawals

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want two-factor authentication required for withdrawals, so that my funds are protected even if my password is compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Wallet_System SHALL require valid 2FA verification for all withdrawal requests above minimum thresholds
2. WHEN 2FA verification fails, THE Wallet_System SHALL reject the withdrawal and log the security event
3. THE Wallet_System SHALL support TOTP-based 2FA using standard authenticator applications
4. THE Wallet_System SHALL allow administrators to configure 2FA requirements per user and amount threshold
5. WHEN 2FA is not configured, THE Wallet_System SHALL require setup before allowing withdrawals
